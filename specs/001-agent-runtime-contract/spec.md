# Feature Specification: Agent Runtime Contract (ARC)

**Feature Branch**: `001-agent-runtime-contract`  
**Created**: 2026-05-13  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Agent Runtime Contract (ARC) - versioned specification of what the Kagenti platform provides to agent containers and what agents must expose in return"

## Clarifications

### Session 2026-05-13

- Q: Should AGENTS.md be pure Markdown or include a machine-parseable section for non-LLM tooling? → A: Markdown with YAML frontmatter. Machine-parseable header (version, target type, available bindings) plus Markdown body.
- Q: How should agents discover MCP servers, given both the MCP Gateway (single broker) and individual MCP servers (ToolHive model) need to be supported? → A: Single `/arc/mcp/servers.json` file in standard `mcpServers` format listing all endpoints (gateway + individual). `ARC_MCP_CONFIG` env var points to the file. Replaces `PLATFORM_MCP_SERVERS` env var.
- Q: When does the controller regenerate the AGENTS.md ConfigMap? → A: On relevant config changes (MCPServerRegistration, tracing config, contract version). Kubernetes propagates updates to mounted volumes automatically via kubelet sync. No Pod restart required.
- Path convention: All ARC-managed content lives under `/arc/` with subdirectories: `/arc/AGENTS.md`, `/arc/mcp/`, `/arc/skills/`. Replaces scattered `/mnt/mcp/`, `/mnt/skills/` paths.
- Env var naming: Kagenti-invented vars use `ARC_` prefix (`ARC_CONTRACT_VERSION`, `ARC_AGENT_ID`, `ARC_NAMESPACE`, `ARC_MCP_CONFIG`). Standard/well-known vars keep their names (`HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY`, `SPIFFE_ENDPOINT_SOCKET`, `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT`, `SERVICE_BINDING_ROOT`).
- AgentRuntime CRD: ARC configuration (which features to inject, OBO opt-in, tracing) is declared via the AgentRuntime CR. Included in this spec as User Story 7.

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Agent Developer Discovers Platform Capabilities (Priority: P1)

An agent developer deploying a new agent container to Kagenti needs to understand what the platform provides (identity, credentials, proxy, telemetry) and what the agent must expose (health probes, A2A card endpoint). Today this information is scattered across Slack threads, docs, and tribal knowledge. With ARC, the developer reads a single file (`/arc/AGENTS.md`) mounted into the container that describes everything the platform injected and everything the agent must provide. All ARC-managed content lives under the `/arc/` root directory (`/arc/AGENTS.md`, `/arc/mcp/`, `/arc/skills/`), giving agents one entry point to the entire contract.

**Why this priority**: Without a discoverable contract, every new agent deployment requires back-and-forth with the platform team. This is the core value proposition of the ARC: make the contract self-documenting and machine-readable inside the running container.

**Independent Test**: Deploy a minimal agent container to a Kagenti-managed namespace and verify that `/arc/AGENTS.md` exists, contains the current contract version, lists all injected `ARC_*` environment variables, describes available mount paths under `/arc/`, and documents required agent endpoints.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an agent Pod managed by Kagenti, **When** the Pod starts, **Then** the file `/arc/AGENTS.md` is mounted and contains the contract version, available environment variables, mount paths, auth behavior, and agent requirements.
2. **Given** an agent Pod managed by Kagenti, **When** the developer reads `/arc/AGENTS.md`, **Then** no cleartext credentials appear in the file; credential retrieval instructions reference file paths under `$SERVICE_BINDING_ROOT`.
3. **Given** an AI-native agent (e.g., Claude Code, OpenClaw), **When** the agent reads `/arc/AGENTS.md` at startup, **Then** it can programmatically determine what platform services are available and self-configure accordingly.

---

### User Story 2 - Platform Injects Identity and Proxy Transparently (Priority: P1)

An agent container receives plain HTTP traffic on its port. It makes outbound requests through `HTTP_PROXY`. The sidecar handles all TLS termination, mTLS authentication, JWT validation, and token exchange. The agent developer never writes authentication code. This is the "Dapr model": talk to localhost, complexity handled behind the scenes.

**Why this priority**: Transparent auth is the primary mechanism that makes Kagenti agents framework-neutral. Without it, every agent framework needs custom auth integration code.

**Independent Test**: Deploy an agent that listens on plain HTTP and makes an outbound HTTP request through the proxy. Verify the sidecar presents the agent's SPIFFE identity on the outbound connection and terminates TLS on inbound connections.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an agent Pod with sidecar injection, **When** an external request arrives, **Then** the sidecar terminates TLS and forwards plain HTTP to the agent container.
2. **Given** an agent Pod with `HTTP_PROXY` configured, **When** the agent makes an outbound HTTP request, **Then** the sidecar intercepts the request, attaches the agent's SPIFFE X.509 SVID, and establishes mTLS with the destination.
3. **Given** a user-to-agent request with a JWT, **When** the sidecar validates the JWT, **Then** the agent receives the plain HTTP request without needing to handle token validation.

---

### User Story 3 - Controller Generates Target-Specific Contracts (Priority: P2)

The Kagenti controller detects the target type of each agent Pod (vanilla Deployment, OpenShell Sandbox, StatefulSet) and generates a target-specific AGENTS.md. A Deployment gets the full sidecar stack documentation. A Sandbox gets a light version noting that identity is managed by the OpenShell supervisor. The agent reads the same file path regardless of target type, but the content reflects what is actually available.

**Why this priority**: Target-specific contracts prevent confusion when agents run in different environments. Without this, an agent in a Sandbox might attempt to use proxy features that were never injected.

**Independent Test**: Deploy agents to two different target types (Deployment and Sandbox) and verify that each Pod's `/arc/AGENTS.md` content differs appropriately: Deployment includes proxy and SPIFFE sections, Sandbox notes "identity managed by OpenShell supervisor."

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an agent with `spec.targetRef.kind: Deployment`, **When** the controller generates AGENTS.md, **Then** the file documents full sidecar injection: proxy, SPIFFE CSI, OTEL env vars, and mTLS/JWT auth paths.
2. **Given** an agent with `spec.targetRef.kind: Sandbox` or the `openshell.ai/managed-by` annotation, **When** the controller generates AGENTS.md, **Then** the file documents light injection (OTEL env vars only) and states that identity is managed by the OpenShell supervisor.
3. **Given** a new agent Pod is created, **When** the controller processes the Pod, **Then** AGENTS.md is generated as a ConfigMap and mounted at `/arc/AGENTS.md` before the agent container starts.

---

### User Story 4 - Contract Versioning Enables Safe Evolution (Priority: P2)

The ARC is versioned from day one (`v1alpha1`). The version is injected as the `ARC_CONTRACT_VERSION` environment variable and stated in AGENTS.md. Adding new environment variables or mount paths does not require a version bump. Renaming, removing, or changing the semantics of existing contract elements requires a version bump with a documented migration path.

**Why this priority**: Versioning prevents silent contract breakage when the platform evolves. Agents can check the contract version and adapt or fail clearly.

**Independent Test**: Deploy an agent, read `ARC_CONTRACT_VERSION`, verify it matches the version in AGENTS.md. Then simulate a contract change (add a new env var) and verify no version bump occurs. Simulate a rename and verify the version increments.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an agent Pod managed by Kagenti, **When** the Pod starts, **Then** the `ARC_CONTRACT_VERSION` environment variable is set and its value matches the version stated in `/arc/AGENTS.md`.
2. **Given** a platform update that adds a new environment variable, **When** the agent Pod restarts, **Then** the contract version remains unchanged and the new variable is documented in AGENTS.md.
3. **Given** a platform update that renames or removes an existing environment variable, **When** the change is deployed, **Then** the contract version is bumped and AGENTS.md includes a migration note describing the change.

---

### User Story 5 - OBO Delegation for User-Context Agent Calls (Priority: P3)

An agent needs to call an external service on behalf of the user who initiated the request (On-Behalf-Of delegation). Two opt-in mechanisms exist: token forwarding (agent reads the inbound `Authorization` header and includes it on outbound requests) and correlation header forwarding (agent forwards `X-Kagenti-Request-Id`, sidecar looks up the stored user token). Agents that don't opt in get client-credentials auth (the agent's own identity).

**Why this priority**: OBO is required for specific customer scenarios (e.g., Sunrise Entra ID integration) but not for all agents. Making it opt-in prevents forcing auth complexity on simple agents.

**Independent Test**: Deploy an agent that forwards the `Authorization` header on outbound requests. Verify the sidecar performs an RFC 8693 token exchange with the agent's identity as the actor. Deploy a second agent that does not forward headers and verify it gets client-credentials auth instead.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an agent that reads and forwards the inbound `Authorization` header, **When** the agent makes an outbound request through the proxy, **Then** the sidecar performs an RFC 8693 token exchange, attaching the agent's identity as the actor.
2. **Given** an agent that forwards the `X-Kagenti-Request-Id` correlation header, **When** the agent makes an outbound request, **Then** the sidecar uses the correlation ID to look up the stored user token and performs the exchange without the agent ever seeing the token.
3. **Given** an agent that does not forward any auth headers, **When** the agent makes an outbound request through the proxy, **Then** the sidecar uses client-credentials auth (the agent's own SPIFFE identity) for the outbound call.

---

### User Story 6 - ServiceBinding-Compatible Credential Projection (Priority: P3)

Credentials (SPIFFE identity, model access keys, trace collector config) are projected as files following the ServiceBinding spec v1.1.0 conventions. The `$SERVICE_BINDING_ROOT` environment variable points to the root directory (default: `/bindings`), with subdirectories for each service category (`identity/`, `model-access/`, `trace-collector/`). Each subdirectory contains a `type` file identifying the service category.

**Why this priority**: Following ServiceBinding conventions means agents built for other ServiceBinding-compatible platforms work on Kagenti without modification, and Kagenti agents are portable to those platforms.

**Independent Test**: Deploy an agent and verify that `$SERVICE_BINDING_ROOT` is set, the expected subdirectories exist, each contains a `type` file, and credentials are readable from the projected file paths.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an agent Pod managed by Kagenti, **When** the Pod starts, **Then** `$SERVICE_BINDING_ROOT` is set (default `/bindings`) and contains subdirectories `identity/`, `model-access/`, and `trace-collector/`.
2. **Given** the `identity/` binding directory, **When** the agent reads its contents, **Then** it finds the SPIFFE X.509 SVID certificate, key, and trust bundle files, plus a `type` file with value `spiffe`.
3. **Given** the `model-access/` binding directory, **When** the agent reads its contents, **Then** it finds the model endpoint URL, API key, and provider type files, plus a `type` file with value `model`.

---

### User Story 7 - AgentRuntime CR Declares ARC Configuration (Priority: P2)

An agent developer declares ARC features (tracing, OBO delegation, MCP server access, skill mounts) in the AgentRuntime custom resource. The controller reads these declarations and configures the webhook injection and ConfigMap generation accordingly. The AgentRuntime CR is the single source of truth for what ARC capabilities an agent opts into.

**Why this priority**: Without a declarative configuration surface, ARC injection becomes all-or-nothing. The AgentRuntime CR lets developers opt into specific features (e.g., enable OBO but skip skills) and lets the controller generate a precise AGENTS.md that reflects only the capabilities actually configured.

**Independent Test**: Create an AgentRuntime CR with tracing enabled and OBO delegation set to token-forwarding mode. Deploy the agent and verify that AGENTS.md reflects exactly these capabilities, `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` is injected, and the OBO section documents token forwarding. Create a second AgentRuntime CR with tracing disabled and no OBO, and verify the agent's AGENTS.md omits those sections.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an AgentRuntime CR with `spec.arc.tracing.enabled: true`, **When** the agent Pod is created, **Then** `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` is injected and AGENTS.md includes the tracing section.
2. **Given** an AgentRuntime CR with `spec.arc.obo.mode: token-forwarding`, **When** the agent Pod is created, **Then** AGENTS.md documents the token forwarding mechanism and the sidecar is configured to perform RFC 8693 exchanges.
3. **Given** an AgentRuntime CR with no ARC overrides (defaults), **When** the agent Pod is created, **Then** the agent receives the base contract (identity, proxy, AGENTS.md) with client-credentials auth and no optional features.
4. **Given** a change to the AgentRuntime CR (e.g., enabling tracing after initial deployment), **When** the controller reconciles the change, **Then** the AGENTS.md ConfigMap is regenerated and the updated contract is propagated to the running Pod.

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens when an agent is deployed to a target type not recognized by the controller? The controller should reject the agent configuration with a clear error message indicating the unsupported target type.
- How does the system handle a Pod that starts before the controller has generated the AGENTS.md ConfigMap? The webhook injection should ensure the ConfigMap volume mount is configured at admission time; if the ConfigMap does not exist yet, the Pod should wait (via an init container or volume mount dependency) rather than start without the contract.
- What happens when an agent reads `/arc/mcp/servers.json` but no MCP servers or gateways are configured? The file MUST contain an empty `mcpServers` object (`{"mcpServers": {}}`), not be omitted, so agents can distinguish "no servers available" from "file not mounted."
- What happens when the sidecar is unavailable but `HTTP_PROXY` is configured? Outbound requests fail with a connection error. The AGENTS.md should document that agents must handle proxy unavailability gracefully (retry with backoff).
- What happens when `$SERVICE_BINDING_ROOT` directories are mounted but empty (e.g., model access not configured for this agent)? The subdirectory should still exist with a `type` file, but without credential files. Agents should check for file existence before attempting to read credentials.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: The Kagenti webhook MUST inject the following environment variables into every managed agent Pod. Kagenti-invented variables use the `ARC_` prefix; standard/well-known variables keep their established names:
  - `ARC_CONTRACT_VERSION` - ARC version (e.g., `v1alpha1`)
  - `ARC_AGENT_ID` - Agent identifier (SPIFFE ID)
  - `ARC_NAMESPACE` - Agent's namespace
  - `ARC_MCP_CONFIG` - Path to MCP server configuration file (`/arc/mcp/servers.json`)
  - `ARC_SKILLS_DIR` - Path to mounted skills (`/arc/skills/`)
  - `HTTP_PROXY` / `HTTPS_PROXY` - Proxy sidecar endpoint (standard)
  - `SPIFFE_ENDPOINT_SOCKET` - SPIRE Workload API socket (standard)
  - `SERVICE_BINDING_ROOT` - ServiceBinding convention root (standard, default: `/bindings`)
- **FR-002**: The Kagenti webhook MUST conditionally inject `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` (standard name) when tracing is enabled in the AgentRuntime CR or at the namespace level.
- **FR-003**: The Kagenti controller MUST generate an `/arc/mcp/servers.json` file in standard `mcpServers` format listing all available MCP endpoints (gateway and individual servers) and mount it into the agent Pod under the `/arc/mcp/` directory.
- **FR-004**: The Kagenti controller MUST generate a target-specific AGENTS.md file for each managed agent Pod and mount it at `/arc/AGENTS.md` via a ConfigMap volume.
- **FR-005**: AGENTS.md MUST conform to the [AGENTS.md open standard](https://agents.md/) and use YAML frontmatter for machine-parseable ARC metadata (contract version, target type, available bindings list) as extension fields. The Markdown body MUST document: available environment variables with current values (except credentials), available mount paths, auth behavior description, agent requirements, and target-specific instructions.
- **FR-006**: AGENTS.md MUST NOT contain cleartext credentials. Credential entries MUST describe retrieval instructions (file paths under `$SERVICE_BINDING_ROOT`).
- **FR-007**: The platform MUST project credentials as files following the ServiceBinding spec v1.1.0 conventions under `$SERVICE_BINDING_ROOT` (default: `/bindings`) with subdirectories `identity/`, `model-access/`, and `trace-collector/`.
- **FR-008**: Each ServiceBinding subdirectory MUST contain a `type` file identifying the service category.
- **FR-009**: The SPIFFE identity binding (`identity/`) MUST contain the X.509 SVID certificate, private key, and trust bundle files, provisioned via the SPIRE CSI driver.
- **FR-010**: All ARC-managed content MUST be mounted under a single `/arc/` root directory: `/arc/AGENTS.md` (contract file), `/arc/mcp/` (MCP server configuration), `/arc/skills/` (skill artifacts). Skill artifacts are populated via an init container; MCP and AGENTS.md are populated via controller-generated ConfigMaps.
- **FR-011**: Every managed agent MUST expose an A2A agent card endpoint at `/.well-known/agent-card.json`.
- **FR-012**: Every managed agent MUST expose liveness and readiness health probe endpoints.
- **FR-013**: The controller MUST detect the target type via `spec.targetRef.kind` (Deployment, StatefulSet, Sandbox) and the `openshell.ai/managed-by` annotation.
- **FR-014**: For Sandbox/OpenShell targets, the controller MUST generate a light AGENTS.md (no proxy sidecar docs, identity noted as managed by OpenShell supervisor) and skip sidecar injection.
- **FR-015**: For Sandbox/OpenShell targets, the webhook MUST still inject OTEL environment variables.
- **FR-016**: The contract version (`v1alpha1`) MUST be injected as `ARC_CONTRACT_VERSION` and stated in AGENTS.md.
- **FR-017**: Adding new environment variables or mount paths MUST NOT require a contract version bump.
- **FR-018**: Renaming, removing, or semantically changing existing contract elements MUST require a version bump with a documented migration path in AGENTS.md.
- **FR-019**: The platform MUST support two opt-in OBO delegation mechanisms: token forwarding (agent forwards `Authorization` header, sidecar performs RFC 8693 exchange) and correlation header forwarding (agent forwards `X-Kagenti-Request-Id`, sidecar looks up stored user token).
- **FR-020**: Agents that do not opt into OBO delegation MUST receive client-credentials auth (agent's own SPIFFE identity) for outbound requests.
- **FR-021**: `/arc/mcp/servers.json` MUST contain an empty `mcpServers` object (`{"mcpServers": {}}`) when no MCP servers or gateways are configured, not be omitted.
- **FR-022**: The controller MUST reject agent configurations that reference unsupported target types with a clear error message.
- **FR-023**: The controller MUST regenerate the AGENTS.md ConfigMap and the `/arc/mcp/servers.json` ConfigMap when relevant platform configuration changes (MCPServerRegistration CRs, AgentRuntime CR, tracing config, contract version). Kubernetes volume propagation delivers updates to running Pods without requiring a restart.
- **FR-024**: ARC feature configuration (tracing, OBO delegation mode, MCP server access, skill mounts) MUST be declared in the AgentRuntime custom resource under `spec.arc`. The controller MUST read these declarations to determine which environment variables, volume mounts, and AGENTS.md sections to generate for each agent.
- **FR-025**: The AgentRuntime CR MUST support at minimum: `spec.arc.tracing.enabled` (boolean), `spec.arc.obo.mode` (none, token-forwarding, correlation-header), and `spec.arc.contractVersion` (override, defaults to current platform version).

### Key Entities

- **Agent Runtime Contract (ARC)**: The versioned specification defining the interface between the Kagenti platform and agent containers. Describes what the platform provides (env vars, mounts, auth, identity) and what agents must expose (endpoints, probes).
- **AGENTS.md**: A controller-generated, target-specific Markdown file mounted at `/arc/AGENTS.md` in every managed agent Pod. Contains the materialized contract for the specific agent's deployment context.
- **Target Type**: The kind of workload hosting the agent (Deployment, StatefulSet, Sandbox). Determines which platform capabilities are injected and what AGENTS.md content is generated.
- **ServiceBinding**: A credential projection convention following the ServiceBinding spec v1.1.0. Credentials are mounted as files under `$SERVICE_BINDING_ROOT` with subdirectories per service category.
- **OBO Delegation**: On-Behalf-Of token exchange mechanism allowing agents to call external services with the calling user's identity. Opt-in via header forwarding.
- **AgentRuntime CR**: The Kubernetes custom resource where agent developers declare which ARC features to enable (tracing, OBO mode, MCP access, skills). The controller reads this CR to configure injection and generate target-specific contract content.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: 100% of managed agent Pods have a readable `/arc/AGENTS.md` file mounted before the agent container starts.
- **SC-002**: Agent developers can deploy a new agent without any platform team assistance by reading only the contract file and public documentation, measured by zero support requests for "what env vars are available" or "how do I configure auth."
- **SC-003**: AI-native agents can self-configure from the contract file within 30 seconds of startup, without requiring hardcoded platform knowledge.
- **SC-004**: Switching an agent between target types (Deployment to StatefulSet, or Deployment to Sandbox) requires zero agent code changes; only the contract content changes.
- **SC-005**: Adding a new platform capability (env var, mount path) to the contract does not break any existing agent deployments.
- **SC-006**: All credential access follows the ServiceBinding convention, verified by agents built for other ServiceBinding-compatible platforms reading Kagenti-projected credentials without modification.
- **SC-007**: Agents that do not opt into OBO delegation continue to function with client-credentials auth, verified by deploying an agent with no auth header forwarding and confirming successful outbound calls.

## Assumptions

- The Kagenti webhook (mutating admission webhook) is the existing injection mechanism and will be extended, not replaced, to inject ARC-related environment variables and volume mounts.
- The Kagenti controller already manages agent Pods and will be extended to generate AGENTS.md ConfigMaps.
- SPIRE is deployed and the CSI driver is available for projecting SPIFFE X.509 SVIDs into agent Pods.
- The `v1alpha1` designation signals that the contract is expected to evolve; breaking changes are permitted with version bumps during the alpha phase.
- OpenShell integration is a forward-looking compatibility concern; the initial implementation focuses on Deployment and StatefulSet targets, with Sandbox support as a fast-follow.
- The AGENTS.md format conforms to the [AGENTS.md open standard](https://agents.md/) (Linux Foundation / Agentic AI Foundation). The spec supports optional YAML frontmatter with forward-compatible extension fields. ARC-specific frontmatter fields (`contract_version`, `target_type`, `bindings`) are treated as extension fields that standard AGENTS.md tooling ignores. This gives compatibility with Claude Code, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI, Cursor, and Copilot out of the box.
- The ServiceBinding Operator is not a hard dependency. Kagenti adopts the directory structure and environment variable conventions from the ServiceBinding spec without requiring the operator itself.
- Skill artifact sourcing (MLflow, OCI) is not fully defined yet. The contract specifies the mount path (`/arc/skills/`) and directory structure, but the source mechanism is subject to change.
- The AgentRuntime CRD already exists in the Kagenti operator. This spec adds ARC-specific fields under `spec.arc` without altering existing AgentRuntime fields.
